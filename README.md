# mvcdemo
A small demo of MVC in C &amp; C++

The executables are located in Dark/Light folders. The sources are available in the MVC folder. The sources cannot be built now as mGLapi is not yet open source. Whenever I make it opensource then try to build it using that library. 

If you want to run the demos you need to resolve some dependencies which it asks when you try to run any View application (Bar, Chart, Pie).

Steps to run

    #1. run Model.exe
    #2. run any View application like (Bar/Pie/Dot) from either Dark or Light folder
    #3. Add or modify data using the buttons
    #4. You can select the particular data entry by clicking on it
    #5. After selection if you hit modify the value of that data entry will be set to some random value.
